This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## GitHub code and Application Deployment
This project can be found on my GitHub: https://github.com/cezarstoian/trello_clone
The application was deployed using Vercel: 
// TODO: add Vercel Link

## Tech Stack
This project was made using the following stack: React, NextJS and MongoDB
// TODO: Talk a little about the tech stack and why I used it

For the DB, I used MongoDB pentru ca asa am vrut, chiar daca se putea implementa, probabil mai bine, folosing o baza de date de tip SQL
